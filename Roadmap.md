## Roadmap to Learn Data Structures and Algorithms with Java

### 📘 Introduction
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts in computer science and play a crucial role in software development. This roadmap will guide you through the process of learning DSA using the Java programming language.

### ✔️ Prerequisites
Before diving into DSA, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of the following concepts:
* Java programming language
* Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
* Basic knowledge of variables, loops, conditionals, and functions in Java

### 🛣️ Roadmap

#### 1. Learn the Basics of Java
* 🔍 **Java Syntax and Fundamentals:**

  * Input/output operations (Scanner for input, System.out for output)
  * **Practice:** Write simple programs to perform arithmetic operations, use different data types, and take user input.
* 🔄 **Control Flow:**
  * Conditional statements (if-else, switch)
  * Loops (for, while, do-while)
  * **Practice:** Write programs to demonstrate the use of conditional statements and loops (e.g., print patterns, simple calculators).
* 🔧 **Methods:**
  * Method declaration, definition, and calling
  * Parameters and return types
  * Recursion
  * **Practice:** Implement recursive methods for problems like calculating factorial, finding Fibonacci numbers, and solving the Tower of Hanoi.
* 🗃️ **Arrays:**
  * Declaration, initialization, access, manipulation
  * **Practice:** Write programs to manipulate arrays (e.g., find the largest element, reverse the array, perform matrix operations).

#### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java
* 🏷️ **Classes and Objects:**
  * Creating and using classes and objects
