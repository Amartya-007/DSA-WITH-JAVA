# **Encapsulation in Java**

Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that bundles the data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, allowing data hiding, which ensures better control and integrity of the data.

Encapsulation helps in:

- **Protecting sensitive data** from unauthorized access.
- **Achieving data hiding** by restricting the access to the internals of an object.
- **Providing a controlled interface** to modify the data using getter and setter methods.

#### Key Components of Encapsulation:

1. **Access Modifiers (private, public, protected)**
2. **Getters and Setters**

---

### **1. Access Modifiers**

Access modifiers define the visibility or scope of a class, variable, method, or constructor. Java provides four main access levels:

| Modifier      | Class | Package | Subclass | World |
| ------------- | ----- | ------- | -------- | ----- |
| **private**   | Yes   | No      | No       | No    |
| **default**   | Yes   | Yes     | No       | No    |
| **protected** | Yes   | Yes     | Yes      | No    |
| **public**    | Yes   | Yes     | Yes      | Yes   |

- **Private:** The `private` access modifier is used to limit the visibility of a member (variable or method) only within the same class. No external class can access or modify this member directly.

- **Public:** The `public` access modifier allows the class members to be accessible from any other class.

- **Protected:** The `protected` modifier allows access to the member within the same package or subclasses in other packages.

#### Example of Access Modifiers:

```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // private variable

    // Public method to display balance
    public void displayBalance() {
        System.out.println("Balance: " + balance);
    }

    // Protected method, accessible to subclasses
    protected void addInterest(double rate) {
        balance += balance * rate;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
        account.displayBalance();  // Allowed since displayBalance is public
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Balance: 0.0
```

---

### **2. Getters and Setters**

Encapsulation is achieved in Java by making fields `private` and providing `public` getter and setter methods to access and update the values of these fields. These methods ensure data validation and control over access to the private fields.

- **Getters** allow reading the private variables.
- **Setters** allow modifying the values with validation logic if needed.

#### Example of Getters and Setters:

```java
class Employee {
    private String name; // private variable
    private int age;

    // Getter method for 'name'
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter method for 'name'
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getter method for 'age'
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Setter method for 'age' with validation
    public void setAge(int age) {
        if(age > 18 && age <= 65) {
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid age!");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new Employee();

        // Setting values using setters
        emp.setName("John Doe");
        emp.setAge(30);

        // Getting values using getters
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + emp.getName());
        System.out.println("Employee Age: " + emp.getAge());
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Employee Name: John Doe
Employee Age: 30
```

### **3. Practice: Implement Encapsulation**

In this example, we will create a `Student` class with private attributes such as `name` and `grade`. Getters and setters will control access to these fields. The example also demonstrates data validation in the setter.

```java
class Student {
    // Private attributes
    private String name;
    private int grade;

    // Constructor
    public Student(String name, int grade) {
        this.name = name;
        setGrade(grade); // Using setter to apply validation
    }

    // Getter for 'name'
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter for 'name'
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getter for 'grade'
    public int getGrade() {
        return grade;
    }

    // Setter for 'grade' with validation
    public void setGrade(int grade) {
        if (grade >= 0 && grade <= 100) {
            this.grade = grade;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid grade! Must be between 0 and 100.");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a student object
        Student student = new Student("Alice", 95);

        // Accessing private variables using getters
        System.out.println("Student Name: " + student.getName());
        System.out.println("Student Grade: " + student.getGrade());

        // Modifying variables using setters
        student.setGrade(105);  // Invalid grade
        student.setGrade(85);   // Valid grade

        System.out.println("Updated Grade: " + student.getGrade());
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Student Name: Alice
Student Grade: 95
Invalid grade! Must be between 0 and 100.
Updated Grade: 85
```

### **Key Points of Encapsulation**:

- Encapsulation ensures that sensitive data is hidden from outside classes.
- Private fields can only be accessed through public getter and setter methods.
- It provides controlled access to the attributes by including validation logic in the setter methods.

This concept is crucial in real-world applications to maintain data security, integrity, and proper access control.

---

Let's dive deeper into the concept of **Encapsulation** with more examples and use cases to give you a clearer understanding. I'll add some additional content around **encapsulation in real-world applications**, **common mistakes**, and **best practices**.

### **4. Why Encapsulation is Important?**

Encapsulation provides a mechanism to bundle the data and the methods that manipulate that data into one unit, typically a class. This helps in maintaining **data integrity** and provides several key advantages:

1. **Data Hiding:**
   Private fields cannot be accessed directly from outside the class, so the data is protected from unintended or malicious modification.

2. **Control over Data:**
   By using getter and setter methods, you can control what values are assigned to the fields. You can also perform data validation inside the setter methods.

3. **Flexibility and Maintainability:**
   By encapsulating the data, you can modify the implementation later without affecting the external code that uses the class. For example, you could change the way a field is stored (e.g., from a `String` to an `Array`) without changing how it's accessed.

4. **Loose Coupling:**
   Encapsulation allows you to change the internals of a class without affecting the external code. This results in looser coupling, which is key for maintaining and scaling codebases.

### **5. Example: Encapsulation in a Real-World Application**

Letâ€™s consider a **Banking Application** where you need to manage customer accounts. You donâ€™t want external classes to access and modify the account balance directly. Instead, you provide controlled access to deposit and withdraw money.

#### Example:

```java
class BankAccount {
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;

    // Constructor
    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double balance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    // Getter for account number
    public String getAccountNumber() {
        return accountNumber;
    }

    // Getter for balance
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // Method to deposit money with validation
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposited: " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid deposit amount.");
        }
    }

    // Method to withdraw money with validation
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Withdrew: " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid withdraw amount.");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("123456789", 500.0);

        // Accessing account balance via getter
        System.out.println("Initial Balance: " + account.getBalance());

        // Depositing money
        account.deposit(200);
        System.out.println("Updated Balance: " + account.getBalance());

        // Trying an invalid deposit
        account.deposit(-50); // Invalid

        // Withdrawing money
        account.withdraw(100);
        System.out.println("Final Balance: " + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Initial Balance: 500.0
Deposited: 200.0
Updated Balance: 700.0
Invalid deposit amount.
Withdrew: 100.0
Final Balance: 600.0
```

In this example:

- The balance is **private**, so no other class can modify it directly.
- Access to the balance is provided through controlled methods like `deposit()` and `withdraw()`, ensuring only valid operations can be performed.

### **6. Common Mistakes in Encapsulation**

1. **Exposing Internal Variables:**
   A common mistake is making fields `public`, which breaks the concept of encapsulation because any external class can directly modify the fields, risking the integrity of the data.

2. **No Validation in Setters:**
   Not performing proper validation inside setter methods can lead to inconsistent or invalid data being stored. Always include checks when modifying critical data.

   ```java
   public void setBalance(double balance) {
       if (balance >= 0) {
           this.balance = balance;
       } else {
           System.out.println("Balance cannot be negative.");
       }
   }
   ```

3. **No Getters/Setters for Sensitive Data:**
   For highly sensitive data, even getters should be avoided if you do not want to expose that data. For example, password fields in a class should not have public getters.

---

### **7. Best Practices for Encapsulation**

- **Always Use Private Fields:**
  Make all fields `private` to prevent direct access and modification. Use getters and setters for controlled access.

- **Validation Logic in Setters:**
  Perform data validation within setters to ensure that only valid values are assigned to fields.

- **Immutability:**
  If the object's state should not change after creation, you can make the fields `final` and omit the setters to achieve **immutability**. For example:

  ```java
  class ImmutableStudent {
      private final String name;
      private final int grade;

      public ImmutableStudent(String name, int grade) {
          this.name = name;
          this.grade = grade;
      }

      // Only getters, no setters
      public String getName() {
          return name;
      }

      public int getGrade() {
          return grade;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Consistency in Naming Conventions:**
  Follow standard naming conventions for getters and setters. The getter method for a variable `name` should be `getName()` and the setter should be `setName()`.

- **Use of Constructors:**
  When initializing fields, constructors are a great way to set values at the time of object creation, allowing you to create an object in a consistent state.

### **8. Advanced Encapsulation: Accessing Encapsulated Data Through Methods**

In some cases, you might want to provide calculated or derived data without directly exposing the internal state. This can also be done through encapsulation.

#### Example: Calculating Interest in a Bank Account

```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // Method to calculate interest without modifying balance directly
    public double calculateInterest(double interestRate) {
        return balance * interestRate;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000.0);
        System.out.println("Balance: " + account.getBalance());
        double interest = account.calculateInterest(0.05);
        System.out.println("Interest at 5%: " + interest);
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Balance: 1000.0
Interest at 5%: 50.0
```

Here, the internal state (`balance`) is still private, but we can calculate derived data (`interest`) using a method without exposing the raw data directly.

---

### **Conclusion**

Encapsulation is a powerful concept that ensures better control over the internal workings of a class. By restricting direct access to class fields and using getters and setters, you can enforce data validation and integrity. This leads to more maintainable, flexible, and secure code.
