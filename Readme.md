# üöÄ DSA WITH JAVA üìö

Welcome to the **DSA WITH JAVA** repository! This project is designed to help you learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using the Java programming language. Whether you're a beginner or looking to brush up on your DSA skills, this roadmap will guide you through the process step-by-step.

## üìñ Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and play a crucial role in software development. This course will cover everything from the basics of Java to advanced algorithms, with plenty of practice exercises to reinforce your learning.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before diving into this course, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of:

- Java programming language
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
- Basic knowledge of variables, loops, conditionals, and functions in Java
  [If not, we will cover them in this course for beginners.]
