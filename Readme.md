# 🚀 DSA WITH JAVA 📚

Welcome to the **DSA WITH JAVA** repository! This project is designed to help you learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using the Java programming language. Whether you're a beginner or looking to brush up on your DSA skills, this roadmap will guide you through the process step-by-step.

## 📖 Introduction
Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and play a crucial role in software development. This course will cover everything from the basics of Java to advanced algorithms, with plenty of practice exercises to reinforce your learning.

## 📋 Prerequisites
#### Before diving into this course, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of:
*  Java programming language
*  Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
*  Basic knowledge of variables, loops, conditionals, and functions in Java [ If not We will cover them in this course for beginner ]
